# Customer Assignments (Sub Bulk Booking) System - Complete Integration

## üéØ Overview

The Customer Assignments feature allows Event Coordinators to assign portions of their bulk parking bookings to specific customers. This system provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customer parking assignments through a modern, responsive user interface.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Model (`back-end/models/subBulkBooking.js`)
```javascript
- owner: ObjectId (Event Coordinator)
- customer: ObjectId (Customer receiving assignment)
- bulkBooking: ObjectId (Parent bulk booking)
- spotsAssigned: Number (Spots allocated to customer)
- startDate: Date (Assignment start date)
- endDate: Date (Assignment end date)
- status: String ['active', 'expired', 'cancelled']
- qrCode: String (Generated QR code for customer access)
- createdAt: Date (Auto-generated)
- updatedAt: Date (Auto-generated)
```

#### 2. Controller (`back-end/controllers/subBulkBookingController.js`)
```javascript
- getSubBulkBookingsByOwner(req, res)
- getSubBulkBookingsByCustomer(req, res)
- getAvailableBulkBookings(req, res)
- createSubBulkBooking(req, res)
- updateSubBulkBooking(req, res)
- deleteSubBulkBooking(req, res)
```

#### 3. Routes (`back-end/routes/subBulkBookingRoutes.js`)

- Responsive design with dark/light mode support

#### 3. Modal Component (`src/components/EventCoordinator/CustomerAssignments/SubBulkBookingModal.tsx`)
- Form-based assignment creation/editing
- Bulk booking selection with availability display
- Customer selection dropdown
- Date range validation
- Spot allocation with availability checking

#### 4. Integration (`src/components/EventCoordinator/Home/Home.tsx`)

8. **Customer** receives notification with QR code access

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (running locally or cloud)
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd GAHDSE241F-ParkWise

# Install backend dependencies
cd back-end
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd "../new front-end"
npm install
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start backend (from back-end directory)
npm run dev

# Start frontend (from new front-end directory)
npm run dev
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure port 5000 is available

2. **Frontend won't start**
   - Check Node.js version
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall

3. **API calls failing**
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Validate authentication tokens

4. **Data not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Ensure database has sample data

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=true npm run dev
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Efficient API calls**: Batch requests where possible
- **Client-side caching**: Store frequently accessed data
- **Lazy loading**: Load components as needed
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI before API confirmation
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time notifications** for assignment updates
2. **Bulk assignment operations** for multiple customers
3. **Assignment templates** for recurring bookings
4. **Advanced filtering and search** capabilities
5. **Export functionality** for assignment reports
6. **Mobile app integration** for QR code scanning
7. **Analytics dashboard** for assignment insights

## üìù Code Examples

### Creating a New Assignment (Frontend)
```typescript
const handleCreateAssignment = async (data: CreateSubBulkBookingRequest) => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const newAssignment = await eventCoordinatorService.createSubBulkBooking(data);
    setSubBookings(prev => [...prev, newAssignment]);
    setIsModalOpen(false);
    // Show success message
  } catch (error) {
    setError('Failed to create assignment');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### API Endpoint (Backend)
```javascript
const createSubBulkBooking = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { owner, customer, bulkBooking, spotsAssigned, startDate, endDate } = req.body;
    
    // Validate availability
    const available = await checkAvailability(bulkBooking, spotsAssigned);
    if (!available) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Insufficient spots available' });
    }
    
    // Generate QR code
    const qrCode = await generateQRCode(assignmentData);
    
    // Create assignment
    const assignment = new SubBulkBooking({
      owner, customer, bulkBooking, spotsAssigned, 
      startDate, endDate, qrCode, status: 'active'
    });
    
    await assignment.save();
    res.status(201).json(assignment);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```
