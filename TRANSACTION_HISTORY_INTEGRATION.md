# Transaction History Integration

This document outlines the implementation of the transaction history feature in the ParkWise app.

## Overview

The transaction history feature allows users to view all their transactions in the ParkWise app, including booking payments and billing payments. It also provides a summary of the user's spending.

## Backend Implementation

### Models

The transaction model (`transactionModel.js`) has been updated to support user IDs for both booking and billing transactions.

### API Endpoints

A new API endpoint has been added to fetch transactions by user ID:

```
GET /api/transactions/user/:userId
```

This endpoint returns:
- A list of transactions for the specified user
- Details about each transaction including type, amount, date, status, and related booking/billing information
- A summary of transactions by type and total amount

## Frontend Implementation

### Models

A new transaction model has been created to handle the data returned by the API:

- `Transaction`: Represents a single transaction with type, amount, date, and related information
- `TransactionSummary`: Provides summary statistics for transactions
- `TransactionResponse`: Combines transactions and summary data

### Services

A transaction service has been implemented to handle API communication:

- `TransactionService.getUserTransactions()`: Fetches transactions for the current user

### UI Components

A new transaction history page has been created that displays:
- A summary card showing total spending and breakdowns by transaction type
- Tabs to filter transactions by type (All, Bookings, Billing)
- A list of transaction cards showing details for each transaction

### Navigation

The transaction history page can be accessed from:
- The profile page via a dedicated button
- The dashboard via a feature card

## Testing

A test script has been created to validate the new API endpoint:

```
npm run test:user-transactions
```

## Running the App

Use the provided PowerShell script to run the app:

```powershell
.\start-app.ps1
```

## Next Steps

- Add search functionality to the transaction history page
- Implement transaction filtering by date range
- Add export functionality for transaction history
