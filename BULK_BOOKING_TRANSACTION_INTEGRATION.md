# Bulk Booking Transaction Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of bulk booking transaction support in the ParkWise system. The integration ensures that when bulk booking chunks are purchased by event coordinators, corresponding transaction records are automatically created and properly tracked in the transaction management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Transaction Model Updates
- **File**: `back-end/models/transactionModel.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `'bulkbooking'` to the transaction type enum
  - Added `bulkBookingId` field with reference to `'BulkBookingChunk'` model
  - Added conditional validation for bulk booking transactions

### 2. Transaction Controller Enhancements
- **File**: `back-end/controllers/transactionController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `BulkBookingChunk` model
  - Enhanced `getTransactionDetails` method to handle bulk booking transactions
  - Enhanced `getAllTransactionsWithDetails` method with bulk booking support
  - Added user and chunk detail mapping for bulk bookings
  - Added bulk booking case in transaction type mapping

### 3. Bulk Booking Controller Updates
- **File**: `back-end/controllers/bulkbookingController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - **Major Addition**: Automatic transaction creation after chunk creation
  - Added pricing calculation using `parking.slotDetails[vehicleType].perDayPrice`
  - Added date range calculation for number of days (inclusive)
  - Added transaction amount calculation: `pricePerDay * totalSpots * numDays`
  - Added automatic transaction record creation with type 'bulkbooking'
  - Added error handling to prevent bulk booking failure if transaction creation fails

### 4. Frontend Payments Component Updates
- **File**: `new front-end/src/components/payments/payments.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `BulkBookingRef` interface for bulk booking transaction data
  - Updated `Transaction` interface to include bulk booking fields
  - Added bulk booking transaction filtering in customer payments view
  - Enhanced table headers to show bulk booking details
  - Added bulk booking-specific display logic for chunk name, company, and user info

### 5. Package.json Fix
- **File**: `back-end/package.json`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed typo in start script from "sever.js" to "server.js"

## Transaction Flow

### Bulk Booking Purchase Process
1. **User initiates bulk booking**: Event coordinator creates a new bulk booking chunk
2. **Chunk creation**: `createBulkBookingChunk` function processes the request
3. **Price calculation**: System calculates total cost based on:
   - Price per day from parking slot details
   - Number of spots purchased
   - Duration (inclusive date range)
4. **Transaction creation**: Automatic transaction record created with:
   - Type: 'bulkbooking'
   - Amount: calculated total cost
   - Reference: bulk booking chunk ID
   - Payment method: 'Credit Card' (configurable)
   - Status: 'Completed' (configurable)

### Transaction Display
- **Admin Dashboard**: Bulk booking transactions appear in transaction lists
- **Payments Component**: Shows bulk booking details including:
  - Chunk name and company information
  - User who made the purchase
  - Transaction amount and status

## API Endpoints

### Transaction Routes
- `GET /api/transactions` - Returns all transactions including bulk bookings
- `GET /api/transactions/details` - Returns transactions with user/landowner/chunk details
- `GET /api/transactions/details-with-info` - Enhanced transaction details with bulk booking info

### Bulk Booking Routes
- `POST /api/bulkbooking` - Creates new bulk booking chunk (automatically creates transaction)
- `GET /api/bulkbooking` - Gets all bulk booking chunks
- `GET /api/bulkbooking/user/:userId` - Gets user-specific bulk booking chunks

## Data Models

### Transaction Model Schema
```javascript
{
  type: { 
    type: String, 
    enum: ['booking', 'billing', 'bulkbooking', 'admin'], 
    required: true 
  },
  bulkBookingId: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'BulkBookingChunk',
    required: function() { return this.type === 'bulkbooking'; }
  },
  amount: { type: Number, required: true },
  method: { type: String, required: true },
  status: { type: String, required: true },
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}
```

### Bulk Booking Model Schema
```javascript
{
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  purchaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  parkingName: { type: String, required: true },
  chunkName: { type: String, required: true },
  company: { type: String, required: true },
  totalSpots: { type: Number, required: true },
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Testing

### Test File
- **File**: `back-end/tests/testBulkBookingTransactions.js`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of bulk booking transaction integration
- **Coverage**:
  - Transaction model validation
  - Existing transaction analysis
  - Transaction creation testing
  - Controller logic verification

### Running Tests
```bash
cd back-end
node tests/testBulkBookingTransactions.js
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- Payment method and status can be made configurable through environment variables if needed

### Default Values
- **Payment Method**: 'Credit Card'
- **Payment Status**: 'Completed'
- **Transaction Date**: Current timestamp

## Error Handling

### Robust Error Management
- Transaction creation errors don't prevent bulk booking creation
- Graceful fallback for missing pricing information
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Validation for required fields

### Error Scenarios
1. **Missing parking details**: Warning logged, transaction created with amount 0
2. **Transaction creation failure**: Warning logged, bulk booking still succeeds
3. **Invalid vehicle type**: Default pricing used or amount set to 0

## Frontend Integration

### Payments Dashboard
- Bulk booking transactions display in customer payments section
- Enhanced table showing chunk name, company, and user information
- Proper filtering and search functionality
- Status management for bulk booking transactions

### Event Coordinator Interface
- Seamless transaction creation during bulk booking purchase
- Transaction confirmation in purchase workflow
- Historical transaction viewing capability

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Payment Methods**: Allow selection of payment method during purchase
2. **Payment Status Flow**: Implement pending â†’ completed payment flow
3. **Partial Payments**: Support for installment-based bulk booking payments
4. **Transaction Reports**: Detailed reporting for bulk booking transactions
5. **Refund Support**: Handle bulk booking cancellations and refunds

### Configuration Options
1. **Configurable Payment Methods**: Environment-based payment method defaults
2. **Pricing Rules**: Advanced pricing calculations for bulk discounts
3. **Tax Integration**: Support for tax calculations in transaction amounts

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Transaction amounts properly validated
- User authentication required for bulk booking creation
- Proper data sanitization for all inputs

### Access Control
- Role-based access for transaction viewing
- Secure API endpoints with proper middleware
- Transaction modification restricted to authorized users

## Monitoring and Logging

### Transaction Tracking
- All bulk booking transactions logged with detailed information
- Error logging for failed transaction creation attempts
- Performance monitoring for transaction creation process

### Debug Information
- Console logging for transaction creation process
- Warning messages for pricing calculation issues
- Success confirmation for completed transactions

## Conclusion

The bulk booking transaction integration provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing financial transactions related to bulk parking spot purchases. The implementation ensures data consistency, proper error handling, and seamless user experience while maintaining the existing system architecture and design patterns.

This integration enables event coordinators to purchase bulk parking spots with automatic transaction recording, while providing administrators with complete visibility into all financial transactions across the platform.
