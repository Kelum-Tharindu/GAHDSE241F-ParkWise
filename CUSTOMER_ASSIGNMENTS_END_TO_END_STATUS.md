## 🛠️ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create Test Data**:
   ```bash
   # Create bulk bookings for testing
   # Create additional test users (customers)
   # Set up parking locations
   ```

2. **Run Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Execute backend API tests
   - Run interactive web tests
   - Validate all CRUD operations

3. **Frontend Testing**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Tharindu\Desktop\nw\GAHDSE241F-ParkWise\new front-end"
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to Event Coordinator dashboard
   # Test Customer Assignments tab
   ```

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd "c:\Users\Tharindu\Desktop\nw\GAHDSE241F-ParkWise\back-end"
npm start

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd "c:\Users\Tharindu\Desktop\nw\GAHDSE241F-ParkWise\new front-end"
npm run dev

# Testing
# Open: http://localhost:5173 (Frontend)
# Open: file:///customer-assignments-integration-test.html (Tests)
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Backend API ✅
- [x] All endpoints responding correctly
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] CRUD operations functional
- [x] Error handling implemented

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Components render correctly
- [ ] API calls successful
- [ ] Form validation working
- [ ] Real-time updates functional

3. **No Bulk Bookings Found**: Create test bulk booking data
4. **Database Connection Issues**: Check MongoDB connection string

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:5000

# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testcoordinator2","password":"Test123!"}'

# Run API tests
cd back-end
node tests/testSubBulkBookingAPI_new.js
```
